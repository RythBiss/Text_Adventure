A text adventure game, simply compile the files in your preferred IDE and run 'em.
I am a beginner in programming and don't know alot of more advanced techniques, so the files must be in the same directory

The game is currently unfinished, here is a changelog:

11/20/2013 - Repository created and files added, currently only a character creation loop is included.
